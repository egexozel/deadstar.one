            <h2>Takako Mamiya's Love Trip</h2>

            <p>Last night while I was going through my YouTube homepage to find something to watch to kill time because I was overwhelmed following the developments in Ukraine, I found this masterpiece by Takako Mamiya. It's an album released in 1982 and apparently this is the only album she has released and there is nothing much known about her. A Japanese citypop album which is praised to be the best in this genre. And let me tell you, It's a frikking banger. Just look at the cover art.</p>

            <h3>Songs</h3>

            <p>Here I will be talking about my favorites on the album.</p>

            <h4>Love Trip</h4>

            <p>The album opens with the song Love Trip, and immediately lays down the groundwork for the sonic structure of the album.</p>

            <p>The lyrics are also on another level. </p>

            <div><p><em>Taking a pink rose</em></p>
            <p><em>Out of its bouquet</em></p>
            <p><em>Placing it on my collar</em></p>
            <p><em>A playful move I'm used to</em></p></div>

            <h4>Chinese Restaurant</h4>

            <p>The following song is 'Chinese Restaurant, which is my favorite song on the whole album. The clever usage of synths, sax solo, percussions and their overall harmony takes you on a <em>Love Trip.</em></p>

            <h4>真夜中のジョーク - A Joke Made at Midnight</h4>

            <p>The third song on the album is 真夜中のジョーク, which translates to, A Joke Made at Midnight. This one is a journey on itself. Be sure to pay attention to the guitar solo on the ending of the song. Japanese are just so cool man.</p>

            <h4>What a Broken Heart Can Do</h4>

            <p>This song is the English version of the album opener, <em>Love Trip.</em> It's, as expected, the only song on the album featuring English lyrics. Probably a way to promote the album outside of Japan. I guess that has worked as Love Trip is arguably the best song overall in the album.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Just do yourself a favor and give this album a listen. I promise, you won't be disappointed. Just a heads up though, for some reason the album is not available on major streaming services such as Spotify. Here's a YouTube link for the album that is a vinyl rip and it's just amazing. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovcnIPL-CWs">Love Trip - Takako Mamiya [ 間宮貴子 ] - 1982 - Full Album</a></p>

            <p>See you later!</p>
